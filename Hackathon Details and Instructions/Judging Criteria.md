# Judging Criteria
Your projects will be judged on the following criteria. Remember that you must use Qiskit!

- **Level**: Student participants will have varying levels of experience with programming and quantum science, therefore we have provided project options requiring varying amounts of expertise. However, we expect students to challenge themselves in order to learn as much as possible from participating. We suggest that you choose a project that is challenging for your level of experience, but achievable.
- **Creativity**: We have provided specific project prompts, but we expect you to show some originality in your solution. If the project itself doesn’t allow any space for improvisation, take it a bit further, suggest a novel application, or analyze a few different solutions.
- **Execution**: Ideally, you will be able to produce a functional solution for the challenge you have chosen. If not, we will consider your progress toward a solution.
- **Presentation**: Choose a medium to clearly display your project and what you accomplished. We will also consider the clarity of your code and your project explanations.
