# Outside Resources
For learning about quantum computing and Qiskit, we've posted some resources in this folder that are not from QCSA.

## Links/Books
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*, Nielsen & Chuang: The most well known textbook on basic quantum information science, which builds up the required math and quantum mechanics and covers the basics of most platforms as well as some important algorithms.
- [*Qiskit Textbook*](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), IBM: Goes through the basics of qubits and quantum circuits, with an emphasis on programming.
- *Quantum Information*, Stephen Barnett: Goes through the more advanced quantum mechanical theory of quantum information, decoherence, and error correction/algorithms.

## IBM Provided Resources
IBM has provided some Fall Fest resources, which we have also included in this folder. These will require some setup to use the autograder feature they've included, so read the instructions in the folder before trying to run the notebooks.
